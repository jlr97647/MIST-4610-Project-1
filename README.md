# Scenario Description:

Our project serves as a project managament platform.

Landowner initiates project: 
The owner of a property seeks to develop the land by constructing a building.

Consults with an architectural firm: 
The landowner approaches an architecture firm to design detailed plans for the building, which include structural, aesthetic, and functional aspects.

Engages a general contractor: 
Once the architectural plans are finalized, the landowner hires a general contractor to manage and oversee the construction process.

General contractor manages subcontractors: 
The general contractor takes on the responsibility of coordinating various specialized trades, such as electricians, plumbers, and other subcontractors, ensuring the project adheres to the approved plans and timeline.

Subcontractor execution: 
Each subcontractor performs their specific duties (e.g., electrical wiring, plumbing, etc.) under the supervision and guidance of the general contractor to complete the project efficiently and within scope.

Project completion: 
The general contractor ensures that all work is completed to the required standards, and the building is ready for occupancy or use by the landowner.
